## What I did for #1 \n
> stayed up past my bedtime \n
> verified my linux environment was up to date \n
> chuckled that windows required a separate guide \n
> verified my rust installation \n
>> updated wasm nightly \n
> cloned the substrate node template \n
> checked out latest branch \n
> compiled the node with Rust's cargo build tool... took a bit :( \n
> shivered a bit at the thought of using ReactJS... ugh node :| \n
> ensured my node installation \n
> realized I should have cloned substrate node template into a backend folder, meh \n
> then realized I should have stood up a container for this tutorial... next time for use \n
> ugh node is dumb and now yarn \n
> cloned the front end in its own folder... very nice! \n
> started the backend @ project root \n
> started the frontend @ project root \n
> yeah it worked \n
> ugh... github personal access tokens \n

## What did for #2 \n
> attempted to get some more sleep \n
> opened the toml file in the runtime directory \n
> copied and pasted "pallet-nicks" into the file \n
> added a comment to signify where it came from \n
> added the pallet-nicks crate to the std arrady of the features table in the toml file \n
> ran the cargo check.. ugh 417 crates, take forever \n
> watched some polkadot propaganda about parachains?? \n
> sitting 397... :| \n
> reviewed pallets src code
> ... getting tired, pushing for tomorrow ... \n
> figured out how to re-add the node template as a git submodule \n
