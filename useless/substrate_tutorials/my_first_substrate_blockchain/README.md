## What I did for #1 <br/>
> stayed up past my bedtime <br/>
> verified my linux environment was up to date <br/>
> chuckled that windows required a separate guide <br/>
> verified my rust installation <br/>
>> updated wasm nightly <br/>
> cloned the substrate node template <br/>
> checked out latest branch <br/>
> compiled the node with Rust's cargo build tool... took a bit :( <br/>
> shivered a bit at the thought of using ReactJS... ugh node :| <br/>
> ensured my node installation <br/>
> realized I should have cloned substrate node template into a backend folder, meh <br/>
> then realized I should have stood up a container for this tutorial... next time for use <br/>
> ugh node is dumb and now yarn <br/>
> cloned the front end in its own folder... very nice! <br/>
> started the backend @ project root <br/>
> started the frontend @ project root <br/>
> yeah it worked <br/>
> ugh... github personal access tokens <br/>

## What did for #2 <br/>
> attempted to get some more sleep <br/>
> opened the toml file in the runtime directory <br/>
> copied and pasted "pallet-nicks" into the file <br/>
> added a comment to signify where it came from <br/>
> added the pallet-nicks crate to the std arrady of the features table in the toml file <br/>
> ran the cargo check.. ugh 417 crates, take forever <br/>
> watched some polkadot propaganda about parachains?? <br/>
> sitting 397... :| <br/>
> reviewed pallets src code <br/>
> ... getting tired, pushing for tomorrow ... <br/>
> figured out how to re-add the node template as a git submodule <br/>
