## What I did
> stayed up past my bedtime
> verified my linux environment was up to date
> chuckled that windows required a separate guide
> verified my rust installation
>> updated wasm nightly
> cloned the substrate node template
> checked out latest branch
> compiled the node with Rust's cargo build tool... took a bit :(
> shivered a bit at the thought of using ReactJS... ugh node :|
> ensured my node installation
> realized I should have cloned substrate node template into a backend folder, meh
> then realized I should have stood up a container for this tutorial... next time for use
> ugh node is dumb and now yarn
> cloned the front end in its own folder... very nice!
> started the backend @ project root
> started the frontend @ project root
> yeah it worked
> ugh... github personal access tokens
